Initial plan was to have an opening page with a list of locations and weather for these locations.
Second page would have a list of things that should be brought for surveying in the weather, personal equipment.

Weather was taken from https://open-meteo.com/en/docs The page was useful in getting options for weather, locations and forecast slots. The API Response section was useful to generate the code necessary to retrieve the data.

Surveyor icon was found on the internet. Use was free once the source was attributed. To keep the look and feel of the page the link was behind a button.

Experimented with bootstrap Carousel, was proving difficult to get working and when reviewing the docs, bootstrap highlighted carousels are generally not compliant with accessibility standards. Cards were preferred as a method of displaying items. 

Getting the code onto the website was a matter of following the instructions. The inital delay until the site was available the first time caused some confusion. 
Editing code using github is a little slow and there is no syntax highlighting. Waiting for a commit to arrive on the website can slow momentum, and if something doesn't work, you need to check the code did update, and the page refreshed before making more edits.
